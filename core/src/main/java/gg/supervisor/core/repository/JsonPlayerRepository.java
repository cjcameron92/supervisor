/**
 * The {@code JsonPlayerRepository} interface extends {@code JsonRepository} and provides a specialized
 * repository for managing player-specific data in JSON storage. This interface is designed to handle
 * the persistence and retrieval of player-related entities in a JSON format.
 *
 * <p>By extending {@code JsonRepository}, this interface inherits all general CRUD functionalities
 * but also serves as a marker for managing player-specific records, such as player profiles,
 * game statistics, or in-game settings. It enables seamless storage and retrieval of player-related data
 * without requiring boilerplate code.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Inherits all CRUD operations from {@code JsonRepository}, including {@code save}, {@code find},
 *     {@code delete}, and {@code containsKey}.</li>
 *     <li>Specifically designed for handling player-based data, allowing for a clear distinction between
 *     general entities and player-specific records.</li>
 *     <li>Facilitates integration with systems that require player data management, such as leaderboards,
 *     in-game progression tracking, or player profiles.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Typical use cases for the {@code JsonPlayerRepository} include:</p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Storing and managing player-specific game data, such as experience points, levels, and achievements.</li>
 *     <li>Saving player settings, configurations, and other customizations that are unique to individual players.</li>
 *     <li>Retrieving player-related statistics for analytics and reporting purposes.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <T> The type of player-specific entities managed by the repository.
