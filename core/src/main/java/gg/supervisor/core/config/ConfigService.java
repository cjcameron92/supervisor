/**
 * The {@code ConfigService} interface provides essential methods for managing configurations
 * across the application. It facilitates operations such as registering, saving, loading, and
 * reloading configuration files. This interface abstracts away the complexities involved in
 * handling configuration files, allowing easy integration into various parts of the application.
 *
 * <p>Configuration management is vital for maintaining flexible settings, customizable
 * properties, and ensuring consistency across different environments. {@code ConfigService}
 * is intended for enterprise-level applications where a central configuration service is needed
 * to maintain numerous configurable components effectively.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Key Responsibilities:</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Manage configuration file extensions, registration, persistence, and loading operations.</li>
 *     <li>Allow developers to register configuration classes, save them to files, or load them as needed.</li>
 *     <li>Facilitate reloading operations, especially useful when configuration files are modified externally.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Typical Use Cases:</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Registering configuration instances for runtime updates and persistence.</li>
 *     <li>Saving the current state of configurations to disk to ensure changes are maintained between restarts.</li>
 *     <li>Loading configurations during application startup to initialize settings correctly.</li>
 *     <li>Reloading configuration values when an update is made externally to reflect the latest changes.</li>
 * </ul>
