/**
 * The {@code Config} interface represents the essential behavior required for managing
 * a configuration file within the system. Implementing this interface provides the means
 * to handle the save, reload, and retrieval operations for configurations, allowing the
 * application to maintain up-to-date settings and preferences.
 *
 * <p>This interface is designed to be implemented by classes that manage the configuration
 * lifecycle. It ensures that configuration files are always current and persist any changes
 * made during the application runtime. Typical implementations could include configurations
 * for databases, application settings, or plugin-specific options.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Primary Responsibilities:</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li><strong>Save</strong> - Persist changes made to the configuration to ensure consistency.</li>
 *     <li><strong>Reload</strong> - Load the configuration file again, which is helpful when the configuration
 *     file is edited outside of the application and must be updated in memory.</li>
 *     <li><strong>Get File</strong> - Provide access to the underlying configuration file, enabling
 *     advanced operations or custom file handling as needed.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Common Usage:</strong></p>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Saving updated configuration settings after changes are made through a user interface or
 *     application action.</li>
 *     <li>Reloading a configuration to reflect external changes without restarting the application.</li>
 *     <li>Accessing the configuration file for custom backup or restoration purposes.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><strong>Framework Integration:</strong></p>
 * <p>The {@code Config} interface is typically used by classes annotated with {@code @Configuration}.
 * The framework will manage these configuration classes automatically, including tasks like
 * registration, validation, and persistence. The interface methods allow for both manual and
 * automated configuration management at runtime, enhancing the flexibility of configuration
 * operations.</p>
 *
 * <p><strong>Example Implementation:</strong></p>
 * <pre>
 * public class DatabaseConfig implements Config {
 *     private File configFile;
 *
 *     public DatabaseConfig(File configFile) {
 *         this.configFile = configFile;
 *     }
 *
 *     {@literal @Override}
 *     public void save() {
 *         // Code to save the current configuration state to the file
 *     }
 *
 *     {@literal @Override}
 *     public void reload() {
 *         // Code to reload the configuration from the file
 *     }
 *
 *     {@literal @Override}
 *     public File getFile() {
 *         return configFile;
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>In the above example, {@code DatabaseConfig} provides specific behavior for saving and
 * reloading configuration related to database settings. The {@code getFile()} method returns
 * the associated configuration file.</p>
 *
 * @see Configuration
